# Development History

I have Home Assistant all over the house, every light switch is ZWave, fireplace and garage doors are Zigbee and the water heater is ESP-Home using WIFI. Everything is already automated except for one of the largest and most power-hungry appliances in the home, the hot tub. For a long time, people have been trying to understand the IQ2020 control board to integrate it to home automation but it's been years and it had not been cracked yet. Equipped with oscilloscopes, the first task was to figure out the expansion port pins. The expansion port is marked as I2C, but the interesting data was RS485. In any case, there are some of the pictures of this phase of the development. All turned out good, no hot tubs where damaged during this phase.
